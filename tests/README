# prggmr's unit tests

prggmr's unit tests are written using the prggmr unittest signal library.

All tests can be run by simply running the ```run.php``` file with prggmr.

    prggmr run.php

To run individual tests just run the test file

    prggmr event.php

Note that individual tests do not generate the standard output and only output
the assertion results.
