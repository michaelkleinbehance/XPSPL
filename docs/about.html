		<h2>
			About
		</h2>
		<p>
			prggmr is much more than just another <em>framework</em>, prggmr is a high-performance event environment for php, depending on the context of which you are developing software with prggmr will dictact how you interact with it, also for the record prggmr is to be spelled using all lowercase characters no exceptions.
		</p>
		<p>
		    I spent 4 years perfecting prggmr and in the end it turned out to be the exact opposite of what I envisioned and
		    the exact of which I thought was impossible. 
		    
		</p>
		<h4>
			What
		</h4>
		<p>
			As previously mentioned prggmr is an event environment which has been developed for use with the PHP Programming language, it provides the ability for developing PHP applications using a complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">Event Driven Architecture</a> in the sense of both "Web" and "System" applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			prggmr uses a hybrid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_programming">Signal Programming</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer Pattern</a> for event processing allowing for developing PHP applications in ways that have only been dreamed of.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most important aspect of prggmr is that it allows for developing PHP applications using a more natural approach, completely decoupled from themselves, simply meaning you can modify a applications flow, structure, data and architecture without modifying pre-existing code.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Why
		</h4>
		<p>
			Simple ...
		</p>
		<p>
			I grew tired of having to make this object contain that object, pass it to this and that do this and pass it to that so I can access it here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sound familiar?
		</p>
		<p>
			I knew there just had to be a better way to write code ...
		</p>
		<h4>
			Who
		</h4>
		<p>
			My name is Nickolas Whiting, I am a self-taught programmer, I've never taken a class on how to write computer software in any way or how to architect complex systems. I built prggmr with <em>no</em> prior knowledge of how to build an event architecture only the goal of changing how I write PHP, it just happened to turn out that other like minded humans have built strangely similar libraries in other languages.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to think that prggmr is completely <em>natural</em> ( other than the API's ), and influenced by nothing other than the desire to change and allow my applications to react to it as nature intended.
		</p>
		<p>
		    I believe in perfectionism and that perfection can be attained and sustained if one has the proper abilities to work their minds
		    beyond that of which they once thought of as impossible.
		</p> 
		<p>
		    I hold myself to no standard as their is only a single level that one must attain, perfect.
		</p>
		<h4>
			How
		</h4>
		<p>
			The most important interesting aspect, prggmr as previously mentioned uses a hybrid of Signals and the Observer Pattern, I consider it a hybrid since it doesn't fully adopt the methodologies of either but instead using only bits and pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The basics of prggmr are detailed below.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Engine
		</h4>
		<p>
			prggmr uses a finely tuned processing engine to provide it's event architecture, the engine handles everything that happens in prggmr from subscribing to debugging those misbehaving subscriptions.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Queue
		</h4>
		<p>
			A priority based queue is used for handling subscriptions, it dictates the order in which subscriptions fire, is the "Observer" part of prggmr and represents a signal.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Signal
		</h4>
		<p>
			The "Signal" part of prggmr and the object which tells the engine what Queue to fire, the signal can be thought of as the object which introduces the change.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Subscription
		</h4>
		<p>
			The subscription is the function which is fired from within the Queue when the engine tells it to do so.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Event
		</h4>
		<p>
			The event is what the engine uses as the change representation, the event is usually automatically generated by the engine and passed around to subscriptions like a batton in a marathon race.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Now for the confusing stuff
		</h4>
		<p>
			Throughout the entire flow each Signal, Subscription and Event belong to nothing they are basically <em>free</em>, each knows nothing about the other and no direct line of communication is ever established between them, prggmr contains <em>no</em> circular object references and other than the Event having reference to the signal and subscription which triggered it, which is never guaranteed, each object is truly its own.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are no closer to understanding prggmr than when you began reading this page then don't worry, prggmr has been built so you need no knowledge of how an event architecture works as prggmr does all of the heavy lifting, you just need to learning a couple of simple functions and your ready to go.
		</p>
		<p>
			Did I mention it does all of this in ~60 KB <em>(excluding comments)</em> of code, without the need for any configuration, autoloading or pre-configuration steps?
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the <a href="api.html">API</a> once you are ready.
		</p>
		<h4>
		    For those that know a little more and feel that you can perfect my code
		</h4>
		<p>
		    prggmr currently does not allow for Complex Event Processing, I'm sure I don't need to answer why, but do not lose hope
		    it is not something that has been giving up on, in-fact it is the next step for prggmr.
		</p>
		<p>
		    As you should know Complex Event Processing is ... well not an easy task, especially when you have very limited resources,
		    this is PHP not C and it needs to be incredibly simple and intuitive to use for the end user, think 2 functions.
		</p>
		<p>
		    If you feel that you can live up to the level I will place on code you contribute and
		    have an impossible idea then please I am prepared to review your work.
		</p>
		<p>
		    If you would like to contribute to prggmr, the above details what is the next step, I strongly believe in open source software,
		    but I am fore warning anyone that contributes.
		</p>
		<p>
		    I will review every byte of code you publish to prggmr, if it does sustain the level of which I do not see as perfect
		    it will not be included.
		</p>
		<p>
		    This may sound almost crazy but my goal is perfection and this is not achieved without it.
