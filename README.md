# Development

You are currently in a development branch.

This branch is not recommended for production use and may not be backwards 
compatible.

# Recursion

This branch is for the removal of the circular object reference that currently 
exists.

# Contribute

Currently the underlying structure for removal is in place.

The problem that currently exists is keeping the engine self dependent so that 
it is still possible to extend the engine into its own space without conflicts.

If you are interested in contributing to the recursion contact me through one of 
the support channels below.
