    About
</h2>
<h4>
    Notice
</h4>
<p>
    prggmr is much more than just another
    <em>framework</em>, prggmr is a high-performance event environment for php,
    depending on the context of which you are developing software with prggmr
    will dictact how you interact with prggmr, also for the record
    prggmr is to be spelled using all lowercase characters no exceptions.
</p>
<h4>
    What
</h4>
<p>
    As previously mentioned prggmr is an event environment which has been developed for
    use with the PHP Programming language, it provides the ability for developing
    PHP applications using a complete
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">Event Driven Architecture</a>
    in the sense of both "Web" and "System" applications. 
</p>
<p>
    prggmr uses a hybrid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_programming">Signal Programming</a> and
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer Pattern</a> for event processing allowing
    for developing PHP applications in ways that have only been dreamed of.
</p>
<p>
    The most important aspect of prggmr is that it allows for developing PHP applications using a more
    natural approach, completely decoupled from themselves, simply meaning you can modify a
    applications flow, structure, data and architecture without modifying code
    pre-existing code.
</p>
<h4>
    Why
</h4>
<p>
    Simple ...
</p>
<p>
    I grew tired of having to make this object contain that object, pass it to this and that do this
    and pass it to that so I can access it here.
</p>
<p>
    Sound familiar?
</p>
<p>
    I knew there just had to be a better way to write code ...
</p>
<h4>
    Who
</h4>
<p>
    My name is Nickolas Whiting, I am a self-taught programmer, I've never taken a class on how to
    write computer software in any way or how to architect complex systems.
    I built prggmr with <em>no</em> prior knowledge of how
    to build an event architecture only the goal of changing how I write PHP, it just happened to
    turn out that other like minded humans have built strangely similar libraries in other languages.
</p>
<p>
    I like to think that prggmr is completely <em>natural</em> ( other than the API's ),
    and influenced by nothing other than the desire to change and allow my applications
    to react to it as nature intended.
</p>
<h4>
    How
</h4>
<p>
    The most important interesting aspect, prggmr as previously mentioned uses a hybrid of Signals and the
    Observer Pattern, I consider it a hybrid since it doesn't fully adopt the methodologies of either
    but instead using only bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
    The basics of prggmr are detailed below.
</p>
<h4>
    Engine
</h4>
<p>
    prggmr uses a finely tuned processing engine to provide it's event architecture, the engine handles
    everything that happens in prggmr from subscribing to debugging those misbehaving subscriptions.
</p>
<h4>
    Queue
</h4>
<p>
    A priority based queue is used for handling subscriptions, it dictates the order in which
    subscriptions fire, is the "Observer" part of prggmr and represents a signal.
</p>
<h4>
    Signal
</h4>
<p>
    The "Signal" part of prggmr and the object which tells the engine what Queue to fire, the signal
    can be thought of as the object which introduces the change.
</p>
<h4>
    Subscription
</h4>
<p>
    The subscription is the function which is fired from within the Queue when the engine tells it to do
    so.
</p>
<h4>
    Event
</h4>
<p>
    The event is what the engine uses as the change representation, the event is usually automatically
    generated by the engine and passed around to subscriptions like a batton in a marathon race.
</p>
<h4>
    Now for the confusing stuff
</h4>
<p>
    Throughout the entire flow each Signal, Subscription and Event belong to nothing they are
    basically <em>free</em>, each knows nothing about the other and no direct line of communication is ever
    established between them, prggmr contains <em>no</em> circular object references and other than the Event
    having reference to the signal and subscription which
    triggered it, which is never guaranteed, each object is truly its own.
</p>
<p>
    If you are no closer to understanding prggmr than when you began reading this page then don't worry,
    prggmr has been built so you need no knowledge of how an event architecture works as prggmr does all
    of the heavy lifting, you just need to learning a couple of simple functions and your ready to go.
</p>
<p>
    Did I mention it does all of this in ~35 KB <em>(excluding comments)</em> of code, without the need for
    any configuration, autoloading or pre-configuration steps?
