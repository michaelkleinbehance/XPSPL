prggmr is currently undergoing a major rewrite of it's internal workings and 
using this branch for ANYTHING other development is a terrible idea!

With the rewrite I am hoping to simplify much of the library, cutdown on 
much of the unneeded code and speed up performance.

Along with that I will be entroducing a more intutive and natural speaking
API for working with signals.

I do not have an estimated release date.

The latest stable version is 0.2.2.

To install

wget http://distr.prggmr.org/prggmr/v0.2.2/prggmr.tar.gz
tar -xzvf prggmr.tar.gz
cd v0.2.2
sudo php pinstall
