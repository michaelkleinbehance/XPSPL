- I have made handles a stateful object since the engine does handle them 
  internally it may be usefull at some point to know exactly what is happening
  with the object, I also added the __invoke magic method to Handle which throws
  a BadMethodCallException, if it wasn't for PHP not passing by reference this
  would not be the case.

- The coupling that existed in the Signal has been cleaned up ... not even sure
  why I did it this way.

- Added the State class that will now be used for any object which will have a
  state, this is done to standardize states throughout prggmr and will be used
  for the Engine and Event objects.

- Added the DEVLOG file, this file is to log out the thoughts and ideas which
  have gone into the development of prggmr, mainly for my own purposes when I
  come back and refactor old code.
