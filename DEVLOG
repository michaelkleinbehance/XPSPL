- With the release of 5.4 this month I'm making PHP 5.4 a requirement, 
  after putting alot of thought into it and having so many places in the 
  code where I need to hack around a Closure not having a bind there 
  is no reason not to ... well other than noone will support it until 2015 
  but thats not my problem is it.

- The utils ... the odd ball ... I really wasn't sure what to name this file,
  but I needed somewhere to place misc functions that didn't fit anywhere else.

- I believe I have finally come to a conclusion on the Queue implementation
  although I am still not pleased with it. The Queue is now a FixedArray
  object which, if PHP does as they say it does should be much faster than
  the old Queue.

  Along with that I need to ensure I convert any normal PHP array into a 
  FixedArray, at least the arrays used within the Engine.

- It has occured to me that the queues do not need a reference to the signal
  their handlers will be dispatched upon since this is already handled by the 
  engine, removing this reference decouples the queue.

- I have made handles a stateful object since the engine does handle them 
  internally it may be usefull at some point to know exactly what is happening
  with the object, I also added the __invoke magic method to Handle which throws
  a BadMethodCallException, if it wasn't for PHP not passing by reference this
  would not be the case.

- The coupling that existed in the Signal has been cleaned up ... not even sure
  why I did it this way.

- I am attempting to trim down the all prggmr objects as much as possible, which 
  should provide some performance gains and really simplify the objects. I'm 
  still wondering how I can trim down the Engine and find a way to move the Time
  based signals into their own little world without having to have the Engine
  do anything special with them.

- Added the State class that will now be used for any object which will have a
  state, this is done to standardize states throughout prggmr and will be used
  for the Engine and Event objects.

- Added the DEVLOG file, this file is to log out the thoughts and ideas which
  have gone into the development of prggmr, mainly for my own purposes when I
  come back and refactor old code.
