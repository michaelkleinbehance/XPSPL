# XPSPL's unit tests

XPSPL's unit tests are written using the XPSPL unittest signal library.

All tests can be run by simply running the ```run.php``` file with XPSPL.

    XPSPL run.php

To run individual tests just run the test file

    XPSPL event.php

Note that individual tests do not generate the standard output and only output
the assertion results.
