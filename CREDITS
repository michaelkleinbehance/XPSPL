    This is at best a list of people or organizations that have contributed to
    or sponsored the development of prggmr, I was researching the Linux source 
    and liked how the CREDITS file is organized so I have adopted the same 
    formatting. It is sorted by contribution date with the fields name (N),
    email (E), description (D) and website (W).
